product1,0.2792000901866441,"['The Apple 2020 iPad (10.2-inch, Wi-Fi, 32GB) - Space Gray (8th Generation) offers budget-friendly excellence, boasting reliable performance, a vibrant Retina display, and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem. Powered by the A12 Bionic chip, it effortlessly handles daily tasks, making it perfect for productivity, entertainment, and casual gaming. Despite its 32GB storage limitation, its affordability and versatility make it a standout choice for those seeking a high-quality tablet experience without breaking the bank.', ""The 2020 Apple iPad is a great device that suits all your basic needs. Although it's not as new as the recent iPads released in the past year, it is still a pretty good device. The 2020 Apple iPad is excellent because of its features, shipping time, price, and battery life.\n\nSome of the many features on the Apple iPad consist of its versatility, such as it can become a mini laptop. It's similar to the Apple iPhone and can do most of the basic things a phone can do, except making a phone call other than facetime. Another feature the iPad has is that, because it's connected to your iCloud account, calls are connected between devices. For example, if someone were to answer a facetime call on their iPhone but soon after the iPhone dies, they can continue to call from their iPad because it's connected via their iCloud. These are just some of the features that the iPad has.\n\nThe shipping time on this device was average. At first, shipping was only supposed to take a week, but Amazon extended it by a few days, but that was not an issue, as was expected. The iPad arrived in good condition, with no dents or scratches, and it also came with a box and a charger. It was not charged when I received it, so I charged it, and everything worked fine.\n\nI bought this iPad for $299. 00. It's not over-priced, and for the quality of this device, it is a pretty good price.\n\nThe battery life of this iPad is pretty good; it lasts about 2 hours on facetime, and for my sister, who uses it to play games, it also lasts about 2 hours if it's being used non-stop and if I don't use it all day it remains on 100%. It does not die quickly, but it charges slowly. The battery life on this iPad is standard.\n\nThe 2020 Apple iPad is an excellent device with minor complications that can be handled. But it is a great device because of its features, the shipping time, the price of the iPad, and the battery life."", 'This iPad is absolutely fantastic! I‚Äôm an android phone user and have previously used a variety of android tablets (Acer, Samsung Galaxy, etc). I have to say - while I still think android phones are superior to apple iPhones (better hardware specs, better price, more features, etc), the iOS really, really shines on the iPad, and this is by far the best tablet I have ever used! I recently switched my main laptop to a MSI gaming PC, which while great at a desk / workstation, isn‚Äôt super portable or great on battery. That was the motivation for purchasing this tablet - to fill the void for simpler, everyday tasks (emails, paying bills, zoom calls, streaming, music, shopping, simple work tasks, etc) on a more portable device with great battery. This iPad does everything it needs to do, isn‚Äôt clunky in any way, has exceptional battery life, ample storage, slim form factor, and - for once with an apple product - THE PRICE IS RIGHT! What‚Äôs not to love?? If you‚Äôre on the fence with this one, just pull the trigger. As other positive reviewers have mentioned, ignore the negative reviews. Those folks didn‚Äôt seem to read the product description / know what they were buying. Educate yourself first and then buy!', 'It‚Äôs awesome!', ""While I have never really been a big mac user, I have to use a few for work and decided to go with the iPhone since my wife already had one. Adding the Ipad to the equation for mobility and other tasks on the go seemed like a good idea versus an android-based solution. I originally wanted this product for drawing and quick note-taking, so the price looked great compared to other products which emphasize one or the other. I'll include some pros and con's here to help anyone make up their minds about getting or not getting this product.\n\nPROs:\n1. The screen quality looks great, very crisp with finer details. I don't generally care too much about the pixel count and what generation retina display something is as much as I just care if it looks good. I've never opened an app and wished I was viewing it on my external monitor due to a degrade in quality. It looks great to me.\n2. Synching between other mac products is pretty simple. While I absolutely hate having to type in username/passwords for everything, this can be solved with a password manager such as LastPass. It was a lot easier to do and now I can view messages from all of my products. This might sound very annoying to some but I have to use slack/Microsoft teams/outlook/etc. for work so it's nice to not miss something just because I'm away from my computer or phone.\n3. The screen size is perfect for what I'm trying to achieve. I'm not a professional designer or architect but I'm using some apps to help me put some remodeling ideas for my home down. The screen size has felt perfect so far for these apps and even photoshop works similarly to its desktop counterpart. The weight isn't too bad to pick up and walk around with either. Keep in mind I don't have a case for mine (I live on the edge).\n4. My daughter is 6y/o and I'm able to find a lot of great apps for her on the app store that would be difficult to get the full experience on my iPhone. While I could get her to do this on the MacBook, it's more difficult for her to work the keys and mouse pad in a way that won't draw her focus away from the learning apps that she is playing with.\n5. The battery life so far is outstanding. While I understand that over time the battery life capacity with the drop to a disgusting degree, at max it lasts me about 2 days on one charge given that I just have regular usage.\n6. If you get the Pencil (the right one), then it is a great experience. It might take some getting used to if you have not drawn on a screen before as it is not the same as on paper. You don't get the rough friction that you do on paper instead, you're greeted by a gliding feeling as your pencil effortlessly moves about. This can be a plus or a minus depending on your own expectations.\n7. I like the fact that the charger is not a micro-USB but rather the same kind that the iPhone takes. I'm all for standardizing charging cables as I hate having to have so many for specific devices. They sell some pretty cool magnetic charging thingys that solve this but they're pretty pricy still (usually 2 for $19.99).\n8. I don't play too many games but I do enjoy a game of league of legends now and then (I'm horrible at it and just play against bots lol). The wild rift game was released for mobile looks and feels and great on the iPad. I've played it on my iPhone and the screen just felt too small to really enjoy it. The iPad size is a good fit though some of the in-game buttons might not be ideal for people with smaller hands.\n\nCONS:\n1. The pencil is great but only if you get the right one. This product will not work with the Pencil 2 which has some enhancements that I wish the first-gen Pencil had *sadness*. I made the mistake of getting the Pencil 2 at first, and while they immediately replaced it for me, it still made me sad to not have the magnetic charging. The synching between the Pencil 1 and the iPad is just very weird.\n2. The apple store is the most aggravating experience I've ever had with anything. I still have NO clue how I actually managed to sign in or if I even did it right at all. It literally has so much security that I can barely get into my own account. It wants your apple id, password, apple code, some other code, and claims to your firstborn child. This process was by far the most annoying part which took the better portion of my day to accomplish (still not sure if I did it right but it's letting me download and pay for stuff ü§∑üèΩ\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è).\n3. The onboard digital keyboard still feels weird to type on. It's like having an iPhone but with smaller hands, if that makes sense lol. I always hate when I have to type something on it just because of how awkward it feels.\n4. The fingerprint authentication is kind of annoying, I tend to switch between my left and right hand and often forget I haven't set my left index to unlock it. They still have the regular manual method of unlocking so this isn't a big issue but I'd like an easier way for my daughter to be able to unlock. Face authentication for a family would be nice.\n5. The camera is kind of horrible when it comes to taking pictures of people. When you're taking pictures of things it looks amazing, but people for some strange reason come out with some odd watercolor-looking effects. If you're hoping to take great pictures I wouldn't suggest this one for that.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a great product with not a lot to really complain about and many of the improvements needed were done on the later versions of the iPad. I think you get more than what you pay for compared to other tablet solutions. I recommend it if you're just looking for a good tablet to compliment any of your other Apple products."", 'I recently decided to purchase an Apple iPad (10.2-inch, Wi-Fi, 128GB) - Gold (Latest Model, 8th Generation). This purchase was important because it is planned to be my new form of note taking for my college classes. After watching many review videos and reviews made by other people who went ahead and purchased it from apple on the amazon website, I felt confident that this model was the one for me and for the use I will be needing out of it. I ended up spending $395 on this purchase and it was money well spent and at a very good price whereas at BestBuy the same iPad with 128 GB was much more expensive.\nThe order came swiftly and was well placed and safely packaged. There were no dents, scratches, or marks on the initial iPads box which seemed like good news. After opening the box and giving the iPad a good look down everything seemed clear and I proceeded to plug the iPad in and start the process of signing into my apple account. The process was quick and painless which made me very happy as I hate signing into things. Overall, I am so satisfied with the iPad so far. No issues whatsoever and very convenient note taking with the apple pencil I also purchased.', 'No surprise here, an easy upgrade for my wife‚Äôs IPAD. Amazon was timely and pricing was as expected.', 'Love it', 'This is the second iPad we have gotten off Amazon in our household. It sees daily use.', 'Been using it for over 3 years now. Its a beast!']"

I highly recommend it, especially when available at an unbeatable price. Five stars, without a doubt!"", 'We\'ve only had our Alexa devices setup for about two weeks now, so we\'re definitely still working out the kinks. With that said, this is a review of everything I\'ve noticed of our entire Alexa ecosystem, which includes 2x Echo Dots, 2x Echo Spots, 2x refurbished Echos, and 1x Echo Sub:\n\nPros: Individually, they all work exactly as they should ALMOST all the time (more on that in the cons section). They all look good, and aren\'t big, ugly hunks of metal and plastic taking up space in your house. They were all incredibly easy to get through initial setup (except the Echo Sub, more below). Music sounds good in all of them, to include the Echo Dots (but it sounds GREAT on the Echos, and fantastic on the Echo/Sub pair).\n\nCons: The voice recognition is almost too good for its own good. We have a fairly open floor plan, with an Echo Spot in the living room and an Echo in the kitchen. Sometimes they both hear a demand, and the wrong device (meaning the one farther away) will respond. I find myself occasionally whispering to an Echo device so its friends don\'t butt in to the convo.\n\nThe Echo Sub needed to be reset 3x when I first got it/went to set it up. I had to log in/out of the app a couple times as well before it was recognized and would actually pair to an Echo.\n\nSometimes Alexa tells me she can\'t complete a request, then my wife (who uses Alexa far less often than I do) will ask the same request and it works...and vice versa. We haven\'t figured out what we\'re doing/saying or not doing/not saying for these discrepancies to happen, but hopefully that\'ll work itself out with time.\n\nThe most irritating issue I have so far is getting music to play on the ""Everywhere"" group. Sometimes I say ""Alexa play music everywhere"" and it just doesn\'t do it. Sometimes it\'ll play on only some of the devices, and sometimes it\'ll only play on the device I was speaking to. Our house is two stories, and we have two kids and a dog, so we spend a ridiculous amount of our time cleaning/walking up and down the stairs. A big part of the reason I bought these was for the music to fill the house while cleaning, and it oftentimes requires me to spend some time arguing with Alexa to get that to happen. It\'s even gotten to the point where I\'ve had to go into the app and manually select ""Everywhere,"" because the voice command just won\'t work.\n\nIndividual components:\n\n2x Echo Dots (w/ separately purchased wall mounts): No complaints. They setup just fine, and work perfectly. They\'re actually bigger than I thought they would be, and look a little clunky mounted to the wall, but overall they don\'t mess up our aesthetic enough for me to dock them a star or anything. 5/5 would recommend.\n\n2x Echo Spots: No complaints again. These were the first two devices we bought, and they worked so well I decided to buy the other devices. My favorite part of these is their ability to pull up security cam footage. My desk is in the basement, so it\'s nice to say ""Alexa show me the driveway"" and see who just pulled in, or to say ""Alexa show me the front door"" when the doorbell rings. I paired these will some web cam covers (also bought on Amazon, of course) so Jeffy and his crew can\'t record me all day long.\n\n2x refurbished Echos (in charcoal): I bought these to play music, and they sound amazing. We\'ll see how they hold up, given that they\'re refurbished equipment, but I have my fingers crossed. They also look great, and are not an eye sore like other speakers.\n\n1x Echo Sub: The only device that gave me an issue with the setup process. For that, I\'d honestly give the Sub 4/5 stars because it really was a pain in the butt getting it properly hooked up. It gave me issues not just connecting to Wifi, but also when pairing with an Echo. Lots of logging in/out of the app, resetting the Sub. Irritating, to say the least. However, with that one star docked, I\'d give it a SOLID 4/5 stars. This thing sounds GREAT. I\'m a huge music lover, but hip hop/rap is really where my loyalty lies. And I NEED bass when I jam, and this thing delivers bass in spades. Even with the setup issue, I\'m planning on buying another for in the basement. If Amazon ever makes a waterproof version, I\'ll buy one for outside for bbqs/parties too.', ""The Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) has become the heartbeat of my smart home, proving that good things do indeed come in small packages.

I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon\'s alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification. Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here\'s the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don\'t give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it\'s enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you\'ll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn\'t want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming. I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night\'s sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner\'s pamphlet there is a way to turn this ""Feature"" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don\'t get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don\'t mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all. Congratulations Amazon, you have destroyed my sanity. Weird goal but excellent execution.', 'Most of the features that sounded so great cost extra money. Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version) Games & stories cost. Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time. I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill. Then 1/2 the time she doesn\'t play what I asked for. Tonight \'she\' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn\'t feel like working. ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother. She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open \'relaxing piano music\' When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again. I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics. I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I\'m never gonna fall in love again"" Hello? WTHeck? Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Fr√®re Jacques! Again, WTHeck? ""She"" even told me she couldn\'t set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row \'she\' opened the \'skill\' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down. I\'ve finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can\'t go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers. This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn\'t ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time. I don\'t know what Amazon thinks it\'s doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated. Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!) Alexa won\'t do anything if it isn\'t asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want. Seniors can\'t use Alexa because if they say play \'xyz\' instead of open \'xzy"" they\'ll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous. If Alexa is an AI, she\'s a pretty stupid one. Alexa can\'t hear properly either, I don\'t know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all. I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I\'ll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong! I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this. You also can\'t tell it to ""Remind me Mom\'s bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""\nThis Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions. It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day. It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm. It can\'t even tell you what yesterday\'s forecast was. It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds). Alexa doesn\'t seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don\'t know that which after a while turns into I don\'t know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given). We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it. This should be stated clearly in description and is not. We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions. It has not once done anything she\'s asked it to do properly. If you don\'t know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you get nothing or something you definitely didn\'t want. You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by. Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with. Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th. Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music. Or relaxing instrumental violin music. In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don\'t get why it can\'t play any of the music I ask for. I know there\'s usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn\'t get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the \'skills\' thing which has \'calm my dog\' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version. and it won\'t just remember you want the standard version. That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.\nAND you can\'t ask it to do two things. Like open a music \'skill\' and play for only xyz time. It does nothing instead. You can\'t even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes. You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes. More time wasting. More things a senior isn\'t going to be able to remember. I don\'t dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I\'d get billed for! The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want. I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why? When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won\'t you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don\'t know that.\nI read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors. I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder. Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa . Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today"" Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa? And why do that? I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it\'s supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn\'t want to confuse it as it can\'t seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it\'s a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You\'re welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course. Of course? What, like I\'m a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.\nWe don\'t have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don\'t use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls. We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom\'s mind active & keep her company.\nCan Alexa do this? Not very well as far as I\'m concerned. Buyer beware!']"
